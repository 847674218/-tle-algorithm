F155	"Only create one CompressionMetadata object per sstable. CompressionMetadata is not shared across threads, we create a new one for each read. The CompressionMetada holds the compressed block offsets in memory. Without being absolutely huge, this is still of non-negligible size as soon as you have a bit of data in the DB. Reallocating this for each read is a very bad idea."
