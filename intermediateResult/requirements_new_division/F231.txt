Somehow, people are running into a situation where nodes are adding themselves to the persisted ring cache. Since SS is initialized after the Gossiper and calls addSavedEndpoint on it, which inits the nodes with a generation of zero, this ends up with nodes using a generation of zero and thus never being marked as alive."
