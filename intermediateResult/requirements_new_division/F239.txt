It looks like cassandra.utils.CLibrary.createHardLinkWithExec() does not check for any errors in the execution of the hard-link-making utility. This could be bad if, for example, the user has put the snapshot directory on a different filesystem from the data directory. The hard linking would fail and the sstable snapshots would not exist, but no error would be reported."
