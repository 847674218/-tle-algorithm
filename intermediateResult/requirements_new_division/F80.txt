F80	Evict gossip state immediately when a token is taken over by a new IP. Replace token leaves the old node state in tact causing problems in cli. in the replace token patch we dont evict the node from the Gossip which will leave the node lingering around and causes issues in cli (UNReachable nodes) As a part of the replace token if the token is replaced with another token we should remove the old nodes Gossip states.
