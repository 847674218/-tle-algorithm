F238	"more efficient allocation of small bloom filters. OpenBitSet can allocate more bytes than it needs. changed OpenBitSet to break big long arrays into pages. However, it always allocate full pages, each page being of size 4096 * 8 bytes. This means that we almost always allocate too much bytes, and for a row that has 1 column, the associated row bloom filter allocates 32760 more bytes than it should."
