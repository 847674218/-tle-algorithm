F234	"allow configuring bloom_filter_fp_chance. BloomFilter FP ratio should be configurable or size-restricted some other way. When you have a live dc and purely analytical dc, in many situations you can have less nodes on the analytical side, but end up getting restricted by having the BloomFilters in-memory, even though you have absolutely no use for them. It would be nice if you could reduce this memory requirement by tuning the desired FP ratio, or even just disabling them altogether."
