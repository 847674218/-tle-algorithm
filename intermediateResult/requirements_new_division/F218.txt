F218	"fix compression ""chunk_length_kb"" option to set correct kb value for thrift/avro. Compression chunk_length_kb is not correctly returned for thrift/avro. fixed the interpretation of chunk_length_kb as a size in bytes but infortunately forgot to convert it back to kb when returning it for thrift/avro. In particular, this means that a describe cf would return things like chunk_length_kb: 65535."
