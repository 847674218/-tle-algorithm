F132	"(CQL) allow numeric keyspace names in USE statement. Can't USE numeric keyspace names in CQL. Cassandra allows keyspace names to start with a digit or an underscore (see o.a.c.db.migration.Migration.isLegalName), but CQL's USE statement only accepts a CQL identifier, which must start with a letter. So there's no way to use a keyspace named ""142"" or ""_hi_"" in CQL"
