F179	"Avoid rescheduling compactions when no compaction was executed. Bizarre Compaction Manager Behaviour. t seems the CompactionManager has gotten itself into a bad state. My 1.0.2 node has been up for 20 hours now - checking via JMX, the compaction manager is reporting that it has completed 14,797,412,000 tasks. Yep, thats right 14 billion tasks and increasing at a rate of roughly 208,400/second."
