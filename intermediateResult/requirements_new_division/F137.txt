F137	Only count compaction as active (for throttling) when they have successfully acquired the compaction lock. Compaction throttling can be too slow. Compaction throttling needs to know how many active compactions are running (to divide bandwith for each active compaction). The way active compaction is counted can be broken because it counts the number of active threads in the executor BUT the thread starts by acquiring a lock.
