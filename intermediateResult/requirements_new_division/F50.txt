F50	"Fix counting CFMetadata towards Memtable liveRatio. NPE in describe_ring. I have a 2 DC, 2 node per DC cluster. DC1 had it's seed replaced but I hadn't restarted. I upgraded to 0.8.4 in the following fashion: -edited seeds -stopped both DC1 nodes -upgraded jars -started both nodes at the same time The non-seed node came up first and showed the following error. Then when the seed node came up, the error went away on the non-seed node but started occurring on the seed node."
