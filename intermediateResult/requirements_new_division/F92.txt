F92	Fix places where uncompressed size of sstables was use in place of the compressed one. Uncompressed sizes are used to estimate space for compaction of compressed sstables. We are using the uncompressed data size when estimating if we have enough to compact sstables. This means we can easily refuse compaction when there is clearly enough room to compact.
