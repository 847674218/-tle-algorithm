F171	"automatically compute sha1 sum for uncompressed data files. Automatically create SHA1 of new sstables. Compressed sstables have block checksums which is great but non-compressed sstables don't for technical/compatibility reasons that I'm not criticizing. It's a bit annoying because when someone comes up with a corrupted file, we really have nothing to help discarding it as bitrot or not. However, it would be fairly trivial/cheap to compute the SHA1 (or other) of whole sstables when creating them. And if it's a new, separate, sstable component, we don't even have to implement anything to check the hash. It would only be there to (manually) check for bitrot when corruption is suspected by the user, or to say check the integrity of backups."
