F206	"(CQL) fix cqlsh support for replicate_on_write. cqlsh: DESCRIBE output for a columnfamily does not work as input to same C* instance. The DESCRIBE COLUMNFAMILY cqlsh command produces output that is intended to be usable as valid CQL (at least, when given to another Cassandra instance of the same version). But the output yields errors when run: So it needs to do a better job of determining which CF attributes are valid for which C* versions."
