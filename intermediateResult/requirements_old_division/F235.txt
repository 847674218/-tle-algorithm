F235	"attempt hint delivery every ten minutes, or when failure detector notifies us that a node is back up, whichever comes first.  Hint handoff throttle delay default changed to 1ms, from 50. Hints are not replayed unless node was marked down. If B drops a write from A because it is overwhelmed (but not dead), A will hint the write. But it will never get notified that B is back up (since it was never down), so it will never attempt hint delivery."
