F150	"prevent nodes that failed to join from hanging around forever. If node fails to join a ring it will stay in joining state indefinately. While attempting to add a new node to my ring something went wrong and I had to terminate the node on ec2. After this the node keeps appearing in the ring command in ""joining"" state and never goes away."
