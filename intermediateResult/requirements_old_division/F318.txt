F318	"fix maxTimestamp to include row tombstones. check most recent TS values in SSTables when a row tombstone has already been encountered. once C* comes across a row tombstone, C* should check the TS on the tombstone against all SSTables. If the most recent TS in an SST is older than the row tombstone, that entire SST (or the remainder of it) can be safely ignored."
