F15	"A counter is a special kind of column used to store a number that incrementally counts the occurrences of a particular event or process. For example, you might use a counter column to count the number of times a page is viewed. Counter columns are different from regular columns in that once a counter is defined, the client application then updates the column value by incrementing (or decrementing) it."
