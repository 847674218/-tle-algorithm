F292	Make Pig deletes disabled by default and configurable. Make Pig/CassandraStorage delete functionality disabled by default and configurable. there is a way to delete column with the CassandraStorage loadstorefunc. In practice it is a bad idea to have that enabled by default. A scenario: do an outer join and you don't have a value for something and then you write out to cassandra all of the attributes of that relation.
