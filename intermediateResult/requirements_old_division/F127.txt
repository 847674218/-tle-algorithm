F127	"Allow one leveled compaction task to kick off another. Allow one leveled compaction task to kick off another. Leveled compaction wants to prevent multiple tasks from running at once, but this check also defeats the ""kick off another compaction if there is more work to do"" code in CompactionTask. So currently LCS relies completely on the every-five-minutes compaction check, which is not enough to keep up with heavy insert load."
