F178	Fix incomplete deletion of delivered hints. Hinted handoff not working after rolling upgrade. While testing rolling upgrades from 0.8.7 to 1.0.2 on a test cluster I've noticed that hinted hand-off didn't always work properly. Hints generated on an upgraded node does not seem to be delivered to other newly upgraded nodes once they rejoin the ring. They only way I've found to get a node to deliver its hints is to restart it.
