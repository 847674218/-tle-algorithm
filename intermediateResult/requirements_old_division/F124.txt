F124	"fix incomplete topology information in describe_ring. describe_ring topology information is wrong/incomplete.  topology information was added to describe_ring, however it asks the gossiper for the DC information, and the gossiper can only have this with a gossip-enabled snitch, which currently means the Ec2Snitch. Instead, it should be asking the snitch for the DC for each endpoint."
