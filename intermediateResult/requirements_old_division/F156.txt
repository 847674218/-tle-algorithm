F156	"cleanup usage of StorageService.setMode() StorageService.setMode() is used inconsistently. StorageService.setMode(), which ends up setting the OperationMode attribute of the related mbean, is used inconsistently. In most places, it's used like ""setMode(""MODE: details""), but in a few places, it's used more like a normal log message. To make this attribute more usable through JMX, setMode() should have a signature like setMode(mode, details), where the mode parameter could be an enum (or even just a string, the main thing is just being consistent). The OperationMode JMX attribute should definitely remain a string, though."
