F319	"avoid streaming empty files with bulk loader if sstablewriter errors out. BulkRecordWriter shouldn't stream any empty data/index files that might be created at end of flush. If by chance, we flush sstables during BulkRecordWriter (we have seen it happen), I want to make sure we don't try to stream them."
