F17	"A Cassandra column family can contain either regular columns or super columns, which adds another level of nesting to the regular column family structure. Super columns are comprised of a (super) column name and an ordered map of sub-columns. A super column can specify a comparator on both the super column name as well as on the sub-column names."
