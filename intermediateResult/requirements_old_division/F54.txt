A streamOutSession acquire a reference on the sstable it will stream and release them as soon as each sstable has been fully streamed. However, since a stream session has currently no means to know when it failed, we'll keep references indefinitely (meaning until next restart) if their is a failure. One way a stream session could very easily fail is if the remote end dies. We must make sure we correctly release sstable references when that happens."
