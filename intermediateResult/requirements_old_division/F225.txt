F225	use cannonical host for local node in nodetool info. nodetool info reports inaccurate datacenter/rack for localhost. The datacenter & rack information provided by 'nodetool info' is incorrect when using 'nodetool -h localhost info'. This is because the IP address passed to the EndpointSnitch to determine the datacenter & rack is sourced from the host parameter provided to nodetool and not the actual endpoint address used in the ring.
