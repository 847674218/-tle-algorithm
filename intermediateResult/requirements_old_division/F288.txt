F288	"(cqlsh) fix deserialization of data. cqlsh: handle situation where data can't be deserialized as expected. When cqlsh tries to deserialize data which doesn't match the expected type (either because the validation type for the column/key alias was changed, or ASSUME has been used), it just fails completely and in most cases won't show any results at all. When there is only one misbehaving value out of a large number, this can be frustrating."
