F120	"remove dependency of clientutil.jar to FBUtilities. clientutil depends on FBUtilities. clientutils' (indirect )dependency on FBUtilities (needed for tests) would result in huge numbers of classes being pulled in transitively.The attached patch moves the bytesToHex and hexToBytes methods into a new class (o.a.c.utils.Hex), which has no external dependencies."
