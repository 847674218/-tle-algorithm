F57	"Fixes for LeveledCompactionStrategy score computation, prioritization, scheduling, and performance. LeveledCompactionStrategy is too complacent. BF size calculation doesn't take into account LCS breaking the output apart into ""bite sized"" sstables, so memory use is much higher than predicted. ManyToMany merging is slow. At least part of this is from running the full reducer machinery against single input sources, which can be optimized away."
